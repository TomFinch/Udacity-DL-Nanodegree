Suggestions to make the project standout

Create a deeper model and use it to generate larger (say 128x128) images of faces.

Read existing literature to see if you can use padding and normalization techniques to generate higher-resolution images.

Implement a learning rate that evolves over time as they did in this CycleGAN Github repo. (https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)

See if you can extend this model and use a CycleGAN to learn to swap different kinds of faces. For example, learn a mapping between faces that have and do not have eye/lip makeup, as they did in this paper. (https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Chang_2018_PAS/Chang-CVPR-2018.pdf)
